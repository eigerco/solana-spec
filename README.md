# Solana Gossip Protocol

This repository contains documentation and implementation details related to the Gossip Protocol used by Solana nodes for inter-node communication.

## Overview

Solana nodes communicate with each other using a custom gossip protocol to maintain data consistency across the network. This protocol allows nodes to share information, such as the current state of their replicated data stores, by sending various types of messages. The protocol plays a crucial role in ensuring that all nodes in the cluster stay synchronized.
